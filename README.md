A unidirectional data flow library for Kotlin and Swift, emphasizing:

* Strong support for state-machine driven UI and navigation.
* Composition and scaling.
* Effortless separation of business and UI concerns.

_**This project is currently experimental and the API subject to breaking changes without notice.**
Follow Square's engineering blog, [The Corner](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/), to see when
this project becomes stable._

While the API is not yet stable, this code is in heavy production use in Android and iOS
apps with millions of users.

## Using Workflows in your project

### Swift

#### Swift Package Manager

[![SwiftPM compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible-orange.svg)](#swift-package-manager)

If you are developing your own package, be sure that Workflow is included in `dependencies`
in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "git@github.com:square/workflow.git", from: "0.21.1")
]
```

In Xcode 11+, add Workflow directly as a dependency to your project with
`File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`. Provide the git URL when prompted: `git@github.com:square/workflow.git`.

#### Cocoapods

[![CocoaPods compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Workflow.svg)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Workflow)

If you use CocoaPods to manage your dependencies, simply add Workflow and WorkflowUI to your
Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Workflow'
pod 'WorkflowUI'
```

### Kotlin

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.squareup.workflow/workflow-core-jvm.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:%22com.squareup.workflow%22)

#### Quick Start

To get started with a fresh, barebones, Workflow-based Android app, we've created a template
repository – just click "Use this template" to create a new repository with a simple but runnable
app: [github.com/square/workflow-android-template](https://github.com/square/workflow-android-template)

#### Maven Artifacts

Artifacts are hosted on Maven Central. If you're using Gradle, ensure `mavenCentral()` appears in
your `repositories` block, and then add dependencies on the following artifacts:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maven Coordinates</th>
    <th>Depend on this if…</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-core-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing a library module/project that uses Workflows, but you don't need to interact
    with the runtime from the outside.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-rx2:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You need to interact with RxJava2 from your Workflows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-testing-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing tests. This should only be included as a test dependency.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-ui-android:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You're writing an Android app that uses Workflows.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Lower-level Artifacts

Most code shouldn't need to depend on these directly. They should generally only be used to build
higher-level integrations with UI frameworks.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Maven Coordinates</th>
    <th>Depend on this if…</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-runtime-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You need to interact directly with the runtime, i.e. streams of renderings and outputs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td nowrap><code>com.squareup.workflow:workflow-ui-core-jvm:x.y.z</code></td>
    <td>You are writing workflow-ui-android for another UI framework. Defines the core types used by
    that artifact.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
